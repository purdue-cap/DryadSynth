2 problems remain to be solved:

- Benchmarks that involve `define-fun` to define some functions and use these functions to define constrains
- Benchmarks that use non-primitive types as input or output of the functions, such as `(BitVec )`, `(Enum )`, `(Array )`
- Benchmarks that use intermediate variables besides the input and output values of the functions to descirbe the constrains.
