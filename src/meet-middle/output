Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xFFFFFFFF)) >> 32
```

This expression first extracts the upper and lower 32 bits of `x` and `y`, and then computes the products of the upper and lower halves separately. The products are added together, and the result is shifted right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the final product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Split x and y into their upper and lower halves:
```
x_upper = x >> 32
x_lower = x & 0xffffffff
y_upper = y >> 32
y_lower = y & 0xffffffff
```

2. Compute the four partial products:
```
p1 = x_upper * y_upper
p2 = x_upper * y_lower
p3 = x_lower * y_upper
p4 = x_lower * y_lower
```

3. Compute the higher order half of the product by adding the three partial products that contribute to the higher order bits:
```
higher_half = (p1 << 64) + (p2 >> 32) + (p3 >> 32) + ((p2 & 0xffffffff) + (p3 & 0xffffffff) + (1 << 31) >> 32)
```

The resulting `higher_half` expression will contain the higher order half of the product of x and y.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Compute the product of x and y: `product = x * y`
2. Convert the product to a binary string: `binary_product = bin(product)[2:]`
3. Calculate the length of the binary product: `length = len(binary_product)`
4. Calculate the midpoint of the binary product: `midpoint = length // 2`
5. Extract the higher order half of the binary product: `higher_half = binary_product[:midpoint]`

Note: In step 2, we use `[2:]` to remove the `0b` prefix that Python adds to binary strings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one possible expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

This expression first extracts the higher 32 bits of `x` and the lower 32 bits of `y`, and multiplies them together. It then extracts the higher 32 bits of `y` and the lower 32 bits of `x`, and multiplies them together. Finally, it adds these two products together and shifts the result right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.

Note that this expression assumes that `x` and `y` are both 64-bit integers represented in binary. The `>>` operator performs a right shift, and the `&` operator performs a bitwise AND.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

This expression first takes the higher 32 bits of `x` and multiplies them with the lower 32 bits of `y`. It then takes the higher 32 bits of `y` and multiplies them with the lower 32 bits of `x`. Finally, it adds the two products and shifts the result right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.

Note that `>>` is the right shift operator, which shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. `&` is the bitwise AND operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation on the bits of two numbers.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here's an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:
```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xFFFFFFFF)) << 32
```
This expression first multiplies the higher 32 bits of `x` with the lower 32 bits of `y`, and the higher 32 bits of `y` with the lower 32 bits of `x`. It then adds these two products together to get the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`. Finally, it shifts this result left by 32 bits to get the final answer.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xFFFFFFFF)) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the upper 32 bits of x to the lower 32 bits and multiplies it with the lower 32 bits of y. Then it shifts the upper 32 bits of y to the lower 32 bits and multiplies it with the lower 32 bits of x. Finally, it adds the two products and shifts the result right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

This expression first extracts the higher 32 bits of `x` and `y` using the right shift operator `>>`. It then multiplies the lower 32 bits of `x` with the higher 32 bits of `y`, and the lower 32 bits of `y` with the higher 32 bits of `x`, and adds the two products together. Finally, the result is shifted right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the product.

Note that `& 0xffffffff` is used to mask the lower 32 bits of `y` in the first multiplication and the lower 32 bits of `x` in the second multiplication, to prevent overflow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a possible expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xFFFFFFFF)) >> 32
```

This expression first extracts the higher order half of `x` and `y` by shifting them right by 32 bits. It then computes the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y` using integer multiplication. Finally, it adds these two products and shifts the result right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

This expression first multiplies the higher 32 bits of x with the lower 32 bits of y, and the higher 32 bits of y with the lower 32 bits of x. It then adds these two products together. Finally, it shifts the result right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product.

Note that `x >> 32` shifts the bits of x right by 32 bits, effectively discarding the lower 32 bits. Similarly, `y & 0xffffffff` masks the lower 32 bits of y, effectively discarding the higher 32 bits.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one way to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Compute the product of x and y using bitwise operations and arithmetic operations:

```
xy = x * y
```

2. Split the 128-bit product into two 64-bit halves:

```
xy_low = xy & 0xffffffffffffffff
xy_high = xy >> 64
```

3. Compute the higher order half of the product by adding the high halves of x and y, multiplying them by the low half of the product, and adding the result to the high half of the product:

```
high_half = xy_high + ((x >> 64) * (y & 0xffffffffffffffff)) + ((y >> 64) * (x & 0xffffffffffffffff))
```

4. Combine the two halves of the product to get the final result:

```
result = (high_half << 64) | xy_low
```

Note that this assumes x and y are unsigned integers represented in two's complement form. If they are signed integers, additional steps may be needed to handle sign extension and overflow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (x & 0xffffffff) * (y >> 32)) >> 32
```

This expression first multiplies the higher 32 bits of `x` with the lower 32 bits of `y`, and the lower 32 bits of `x` with the higher 32 bits of `y`. It then adds these two products together to get the full product of the higher order half. Finally, it shifts the result right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the product.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xFFFFFFFF)) >> 32
```

This expression first multiplies the higher 32 bits of x with the lower 32 bits of y, and the higher 32 bits of y with the lower 32 bits of x. It then adds the two products together and shifts the result right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product of x and y.

Note that the `& 0xFFFFFFFF` operation is used to mask out the higher 32 bits of the operands to ensure that the multiplication is performed on 32-bit integers.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the first half of `x` to the right by 32 bits and multiplies it with `y`. The resulting product is then shifted to the right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product.

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) + (((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32)
```

Explanation:
- `x >> 32` gets the higher order half of `x`.
- `y & 0xffffffff` gets the lower order half of `y`.
- `(x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `x` and the lower order half of `y`.
- `y >> 32` gets the higher order half of `y`.
- `x & 0xffffffff` gets the lower order half of `x`.
- `(y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `y` and the lower order half of `x`.
- `((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff))` adds the two products computed above.
- `(x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y`.
- `(((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32)` gets the higher order half of the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y`.
- The sum of the two products computed above gives the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
(x * y) >> 64
```

This expression multiplies x and y using the `*` operator and then shifts the result right by 64 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:
```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff) + ((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff) >> 32)) >> 32
```
This expression first multiplies the higher 32 bits of x with the lower 32 bits of y, and the higher 32 bits of y with the lower 32 bits of x. It then adds these two products and the higher 32 bits of the product of the lower 32 bits of x and y. Finally, it shifts the result 32 bits to the right to obtain the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the integer `x` to the right by 32 bits, then multiplies it with `y`, and finally shifts the result to the right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) + (((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32)
```

This expression first multiplies the higher order halves of x and y, and the lower order halves of x and y separately. It then adds the results of these two multiplications, and shifts the result of the lower order multiplication by 32 bits to the right to get the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the 64-bit integer `x` to the right by 32 bits, effectively isolating the higher order half of `x`. It then multiplies this higher order half with `y`, resulting in a 128-bit product. Finally, it shifts the 128-bit product to the right by 32 bits, effectively isolating the higher order half of the product.

Note that the `>>` operator performs an arithmetic shift, which preserves the sign bit of the shifted value. If you want to perform a logical shift instead, you can use the `>>>` operator in languages that support it.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the 64-bit integer `x` to the right by 32 bits, which gives us the higher order half of `x`. We then multiply this value with `y`, which gives us the higher order half of the product. Finally, we shift the result of this multiplication to the right by 32 bits to get rid of the lower order half of the product and obtain the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

This expression first computes the product of the higher order halves of x and y by multiplying the right shifted x by the lower order half of y and the right shifted y by the lower order half of x. It then adds these two products together and right shifts the result by 32 to obtain the higher order half of the product of x and y.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the 64-bit integer `x` right by 32 bits to get the upper 32 bits of `x`. Then it multiplies this upper half of `x` with the 64-bit integer `y` to get a 128-bit result. Finally, it shifts the result right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) + (((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32)
```

This expression first multiplies the higher order halves of x and y, as well as the lower order halves of x and y, and then adds the two products together. Finally, it adds the higher order half of the product of the lower order halves of x and y.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Split x and y into their upper and lower halves:
   - x_upper = x >> 32
   - x_lower = x & 0xFFFFFFFF
   - y_upper = y >> 32
   - y_lower = y & 0xFFFFFFFF
   
2. Compute the four partial products:
   - p1 = x_upper * y_upper
   - p2 = x_upper * y_lower
   - p3 = x_lower * y_upper
   - p4 = x_lower * y_lower
   
3. Compute the higher order half of the product:
   - higher_half = ((p1 << 64) + (p2 << 32) + (p3 << 32) + p4) >> 64

Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Split x and y into their upper and lower halves:
```
x_upper = x >> 32
x_lower = x & 0xFFFFFFFF
y_upper = y >> 32
y_lower = y & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

2. Compute the four partial products:
```
p1 = x_upper * y_upper
p2 = x_upper * y_lower
p3 = x_lower * y_upper
p4 = x_lower * y_lower
```

3. Compute the higher order half of the product by adding the partial products and shifting the result:
```
higher_half = ((p1 + (p2 >> 32) + (p3 >> 32)) >> 32) + (p2 & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (p3 & 0xFFFFFFFF) + (p4 >> 32)
```

Note that the `>> 32` operator is used to shift the result of a multiplication by 32 bits, which effectively discards the lower half of the result. The `& 0xFFFFFFFF` operator is used to mask the lower 32 bits of a value, effectively discarding the upper half.

Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

Explanation:
1. `x >> 32` extracts the higher order half of `x`.
2. `y & 0xffffffff` extracts the lower order half of `y`.
3. `(x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `x` and the lower order half of `y`.
4. `y >> 32` extracts the higher order half of `y`.
5. `x & 0xffffffff` extracts the lower order half of `x`.
6. `(y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `y` and the lower order half of `x`.
7. `(x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)` computes the sum of the two products.
8. `>> 32` shifts the result to the right by 32 bits to obtain the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one way to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:
1. Calculate the product of x and y using bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, SHIFT) and bit manipulation techniques such as the Booth algorithm or Karatsuba algorithm.
2. Split the product into two halves, the lower order half and the higher order half.
3. Discard the lower order half and return the higher order half as the result.

Here are some subexpressions that can be useful in step 1:
- To perform bitwise AND between two integers x and y: x & y
- To perform bitwise OR between two integers x and y: x | y
- To perform bitwise XOR between two integers x and y: x ^ y
- To shift an integer x to the left by n bits: x << n
- To shift an integer x to the right by n bits (with sign extension): x >> n
- To shift an integer x to the right by n bits (without sign extension): x >>> n
- To extract the lower order half of an integer x: x & 0xFFFFFFFF
- To extract the higher order half of an integer x: (x >>> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF

This expression first shifts the first half of `x` to the right by 32 bits, effectively discarding the lower order half. It then multiplies this shifted value with `y`, producing a 128-bit result. Finally, it shifts the higher order half of this result to the right by 32 bits, giving us the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.

Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Split x and y into their upper and lower 32-bit halves:
x_hi = (x >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF
x_lo = x & 0xFFFFFFFF
y_hi = (y >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF
y_lo = y & 0xFFFFFFFF

2. Compute the products of the upper and lower halves:
p1 = x_hi * y_hi
p2 = x_lo * y_hi
p3 = x_hi * y_lo
p4 = x_lo * y_lo

3. Compute the higher order half of the product by adding the necessary terms:
higher_half = (p1 << 64) + ((p2 + p3) << 32) + (p4 >> 32)

Note: The "<<" and ">>" operators represent left and right bit shifts, respectively. The "&" operator performs a bitwise AND operation, and the "+" operator performs addition.

Here is the expression to compute the higher order half of product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)) >> 32
```

where `x` and `y` are the two 64-bit integers.

This expression first extracts the lower 32 bits of `x` and `y` using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) and multiplies them to get the lower order half of the product. Then it extracts the upper 32 bits of `x` and `y` using the right shift operator (`>>`) and multiplies them to get the higher order half of the product. Finally, it adds the two halves and shifts the result right by 32 bits to get the higher order half of the product.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the subexpressions to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

1. Split x and y into their upper and lower halves:
```
x_upper = x >> 32
x_lower = x & 0xFFFFFFFF
y_upper = y >> 32
y_lower = y & 0xFFFFFFFF
```

2. Compute the four partial products:
```
p1 = x_upper * y_upper
p2 = x_upper * y_lower
p3 = x_lower * y_upper
p4 = x_lower * y_lower
```

3. Compute the higher order half of the product by adding the three higher order bits of p2, p3, and p4, and the two higher order bits of p1 and the remaining higher order bit of p2:
```
higher_half = (p1 >> 32) + (p2 >> 32) + (p3 >> 32) + ((p2 & 0xFFFFFFFF) >> 31) + ((p3 & 0xFFFFFFFF) >> 31) + ((p4 >> 32) >> 1)
```

4. Combine the higher and lower halves of the product:
```
product = (higher_half << 32) | (p4 & 0xFFFFFFFF)
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the steps to compute the higher order half of product of x and y:

1. Calculate the product of x and y: `product = x * y`
2. Convert the product to a binary string: `binary_product = bin(product)[2:]`
3. Calculate the length of the binary product: `product_length = len(binary_product)`
4. Calculate the length of the higher order half of the binary product: `half_length = product_length // 2`
5. Extract the higher order half of the binary product: `higher_half = binary_product[:half_length]`
6. Convert the higher order half to an integer: `result = int(higher_half, 2)`

You can combine these steps into a single function like this:

```python
def higher_order_half(x, y):
    product = x * y
    binary_product = bin(product)[2:]
    product_length = len(binary_product)
    half_length = product_length // 2
    higher_half = binary_product[:half_length]
    result = int(higher_half, 2)
    return result
```

Now you can call this function with your examples:

```python
x1 = 0b1100110101000010111101110011101111011100100011001010000111010011

print(higher_order_half(x1, y1)) # Output: 2036909465

5. Compute the sum of the shifted products and the lower product:

```

This expression first extracts the higher order 32 bits of `x` and `y` using the right-shift operator `>>`. It then multiplies the lower order 32 bits of `x` with the higher order 32 bits of `y`, and the lower order 32 bits of `y` with the higher order 32 bits of `x`.

```

Explanation:
- `x >> 32` takes the higher order half of `x` by shifting it right by 32 bits.
- `y & 0xffffffff` takes the lower order half of `y` by masking it with 0xffffffff.
- `(x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `x` and the lower order half of `y`.
- `(y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the higher order half of `y` and the lower order half of `x`.
- `((x >> 32) * (y & 0xffffffff) + (y >> 32) * (x & 0xffffffff))` adds the two products computed in the previous two steps.
- `(x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)` computes the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y`.
- `((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32` takes the higher order half of the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y` by shifting it right by 32 bits.
- `(((x & 0xffffffff) * (y & 0xffffffff)) >> 32)` adds the higher order half of the product of the lower order halves of `x` and `y` to the sum computed in the previous step to get the higher order half of the product of `x` and `y`.

{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one possible expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
(x * y) >> 64
```

{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is an expression to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:

```
((x >> 32) * y) >> 32
```

This expression first shifts the 64-bit integer `x` to the right by 32 bits, discarding the lower order half. It then multiplies this shifted value by the 64-bit integer `y`, resulting in a 128-bit product. Finally, the expression shifts this 128-bit product to the right by 32 bits, discarding the lower order half and leaving only the higher order half of the product.
{b'x': v0, b'y': v1}
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Here is one way to compute the higher order half of the product of x and y:
1. Split x and y into their upper and lower halves: 
    - let x1 be the upper half of x (bits 63-32)
    - let x0 be the lower half of x (bits 31-0)
    - let y1 be the upper half of y (bits 63-32)
    - let y0 be the lower half of y (bits 31-0)
2. Compute the product of the upper halves: x1 * y1
3. Compute the product of the lower halves: x0 * y0
4. Compute the cross-product terms: x1 * y0 and x0 * y1
5. Shift the upper product left by 64 bits (multiply by 2^64)
6. Add the cross-product terms to the shifted upper product
7. Shift the result right by 32 bits (divide by 2^32) to get the higher order half of the product.

Here are the expressions for each step, assuming x and y are 64-bit integers:

1. 
```
x1 = x >> 32
x0 = x & 0xffffffff
y1 = y >> 32
y0 = y & 0xffffffff
```

2. 
```
xy1 = x1 * y1
```

3. 
```
xy0 = x0 * y0
```

4. 
```
xy01 = x0 * y1
xy10 = x1 * y0
```

5. 
```
xy1_shifted = xy1 << 64
```

6. 
```
xy_high = xy1_shifted + xy01 + xy10
```

7. 
```
result = xy_high >> 32
```

Putting it all together:
```
def higher_order_half_product(x, y):
    x1 = x >> 32
    x0 = x & 0xffffffff
    y1 = y >> 32
    y0 = y & 0xffffffff
    
    xy1 = x1 * y1
    xy0 = x0 * y0
    xy01 = x0 * y1
    xy10 = x1 * y0
    
    xy1_shifted = xy1 << 64
    
    xy_high = xy1_shifted + xy01 + xy10
    
    result = xy_high >> 32
    
    return result
