# Background : Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS)

## Program Synthesis

- Problem: Generate program automatically from high-level specifications
    - From WHAT to HOW

. . .

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm, auto]
\node[box] (S) {Specification};
\node[box, right=of S] (Sy) {Synthesizer};
\node[box, right=of Sy] (P) {Program};
\path[->] (S) edge (Sy) (Sy) edge (P);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

. . .

- Combining high-level insights and low-level implementations
    - Low-level is natural for computers
    - High-level is a more humanly job
- Central Challenge: Establishing a synergy between the programmer and the synthesizer

## Formal Expression of an Example Synthesis Problem

- Problem: Synthesis of the `max2` function, which accepts 2 arguments and returns the larger-in-value one.
    - Problem must be defined on a certain background theory (eg. LIA, Linear Integer Arithmetics)

. . .

- Find an LIA binary function $f(x, y)$ such that
\[\left( f(x,y) = x \lor f(x, y) = y \right)
\land f(x,y) \ge x \land f(x,y) \ge y \]

. . .

- Find a program that meets a correctness specification ("constraints") given as a logical formula.

. . .

- Solution `f(x, y) = ite(x >= y, x, y)`

## Syntax-Guided Synthesis: Concept ^[Syntax-Guided Synthesis, R. Alur, et al. In 13th International Conference on Formal Methods in Computer-Aided Design, 2013.]

- Supplement the logical specification with a syntactic template
    - The space of allowed implementation is constrained
- Benefits
    - Constrained space make the problem more tractable
    - Specified syntactic constraints could be used in optimizations
- Essentially combines humanly insight into computer's low-level rapidness

. . .

## `max2` in SyGuS ^[Described in the SyGuS-IF language, arXiv:1405.5590v2 [cs.PL] 23 Oct 2016]

```
(synth-fun max2 ((x Int) (y Int)) Int
((Start Int (x y 0 1
             (+ Start Start)
             (- Start Start)
             (ite StartBool Start Start)))

 (StartBool Bool ((and StartBool StartBool)
                  (or StartBool StartBool)
                  (not StartBool)
                  (<= Start Start)
                  (= Start Start)
                  (>= Start Start)))))
```

- Uses a context-free grammar to set the syntactic restrictions on the problem.

## SyGus Problem Description

Essences of a SyGuS problem:

- A Fixed Background theory $T$: Fixed types and operations
- Function(s) to be synthesized: name(s) $f$ with type(s)
- Inputs to the problem:
    - Specification $\phi$ as typed formula using symbols in $T$ and symbol $f$
    - Context-free grammar $G$, characterizing the set of allowed expressions $[[G]]$ in $T$
- Find expression $e$ in $[[G]]$ such that $\phi[f/e]$ is valid in $T$


## SyGuS-COMP: Tracks

- SyGuS-COMP: A series of competitions for solvers on SyGuS problems.
    - Problems and solvers are organized into tracks.
    - Track: A set of problems classified by their predefined background theory and syntactic restrictions.
- SyGuS-COMP'17 has 5 tracks:
    - General Track
    - INV Track: Invariant Synthesis Track
    - CLIA Track: Conditional Linear Integer Arithmetics Track
    - PBE Strings Track: Program By Examples on Strings Track
    - PBE Bitvectiors Track: Program By Examples on Bitvectors Track

. . .

- DryadSynth took part in SyGuS-COMP'17 and participated in CLIA and INV track.

## CLIA Track

- Theory: Linear Integer Arithmetics
     - Only linear operations are allowed in the expressions
     - All variable types are limited to integers only
- Syntactic Restrictions: Conditional LIA functions
    - Only operations in theory and conditional expressions are allowed in function expression.
    - Only linear operations and ITEs (if-then-else) are allowed.

## INV Track

- Theory: LIA
- Syntactic Restrictions: Conditional LIA predicates
    - Same as CLIA, except expressions should be predicates rather than functions..

. . .

- All specifications are structured in form of pre-condition, post-condition and a transition relation

## INV Track Problem Description

Given predicate on certain integer varaibles and their primed versions:
\[\pref(x, y), \transf(x, y, x' ,y'), \postf(x, y)\]

Find a Conditional LIA predicate $\invf(x, y)$ such that
\[\pref(x,y) \Rightarrow \invf(x, y)\]
\[\transf(x,y, x', y')\land\invf(x, y) \Rightarrow \invf(x', y')\]
\[\invf(x,y) \Rightarrow \postf(x,y)\]

. . .

- Essentially catches the invariant in a loop designated by the input predicates.
- In our algorithm, INV and CLIA are actually similar problems.

# DryadSynth: Approach and Optimizations

## DryadSynth

- Explicit + Symbolic Search
- Decision-tree Representation
- One Solver for 2 tracks: CLIA + INV
- Lightweight Implementation based on Z3 (LoC < 2k)

## CLIA Functions: Decision Tree Representation

- Consider $n$-ary CLIA function $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$
- Observe that every atomic LIA (in)equation could be converted to form $p(c_0, c_1, \dots, d_n)\ge 0$,
with $p$ being a normalized linear expression:
\[p(c_0, c_1, \dots, c_n) = c_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^{n} c_ix_i\]

. . .

- Any CLIA function could be normalized to a binary tree of normalized linear expressions
    - Non-leaf nodes are ITE expressions, with $p \ge 0$ being condition predicate
    - Leaf nodes are return expressions, returning $p$ as function value

---


Denote that normalized linear expression
\[p^{(i)} = p(c_0^{(i)}, c_1^{(i)}, \dots, c_n^{(i)})\]

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=12em},
level 2/.style={sibling distance=6em}, align=center,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$p^{(0)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$p^{(1)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l2) {rtn \\ $p^{(3)}$} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r2) {rtn \\ $p^{(4)}$} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[left] {true}
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$p^{(2)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l3) {rtn \\ $p^{(5)}$} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r3) {rtn \\ $p^{(6)}$} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[right] {false}
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

---

Denote that the coefficient array in $p^{(i)}$ as
\[A^{(i)} = (c_0^{(i)}, c_1^{(i)}, \dots, c_n^{(i)})\]

The decision tree could be stored in form
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=12em},
level 2/.style={sibling distance=6em}, align=center,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$A^{(0)}$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$A^{(1)}$}
child {node[box] (l2) {$A^{(3)}$} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r2) {$A^{(4)}$} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[left] {true}
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$A^{(2)}$}
child {node[box] (l3) {$A^{(5)}$} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r3) {$A^{(6)}$} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[right] {false}
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

## Example: `max2` decision tree

\[(a,b,c) \rightarrow ax + by + c\]


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=12em},
align=center,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$(1, -1, 0)$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$(1, 0, 0)$}
edge from parent node[left] {true}
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$(0, 1, 0)$}
edge from parent node[right] {false}
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

```
max2(x, y) = ite(x - y >=0 , x, y)
```

## Full decision trees


An non-full decision tree could always find a full decision tree equivalent.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=16em},
level 2/.style={sibling distance=8em}, align=center,
level distance=1cm,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$A^{(0)}$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$A^{(1)}$}
child {node[box] (l2) {$A^{(3)}$} edge from parent }
child {node[box] (r2) {$A^{(4)}$} edge from parent }
edge from parent
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$A^{(2)}$}
edge from parent
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=16em},
level 2/.style={sibling distance=8em}, align=center,
level distance=1cm,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$A^{(0)}$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$A^{(1)}$}
child {node[box] (l2) {$A^{(3)}$} edge from parent }
child {node[box] (r2) {$A^{(4)}$} edge from parent }
edge from parent
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$0$}
child {node[box] (l3) {$A^{(2)}$} edge from parent }
child {node[box] (r3) {$0$} edge from parent }
edge from parent
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

- Completeness for CLIA functions is guaranteed.

## CEGIS Framework

- CEGIS: CounterExample Guided Inductive Synthesis ^[A. Solar-Lezama, et al. "Combinatorial sketching for finite programs," in ASPLOS'06. ACM, 2006, pp. 404â€“415.]
- Candidate-Counterexample iterations drive inductive synthesis.

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=2cm, auto, align=center]
\node[box] (input) {Input\\Specifications};
\node[box, inner sep=5mm, below of=input, node distance=2.5cm] (synth) {Synthesizer};
\node[box, inner sep=5mm, right of=synth, node distance=6cm] (ver) {Verifier};
\node[box, below of=synth] (nosol) {Synthesis Failure};
\node[box, below of=ver] (sol) {Synthesis Success};
\path[->] (input) edge node[left]{Initial\\Constraints} (synth)
(synth) edge[bend left] node[above] {Candidates} (ver)

(synth) edge node[left] {No proper\\candidates} (nosol)
(ver) edge node[right] {Verification\\Passed} (sol);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

## DryadSynth: Symbolic search in CEGIS


- Symbolic search for fixed tree height is performed in CEGIS loop.
- For a fixed height $h$, decision tree represents a function with non-concrete coefficients
    \[ f (x_1, \dots, x_n) = ite(p_0 \ge 0, ite(\dots), \dots)\]
- A concrete input point makes it a function of coefficients
    \[ f(w) = g(c_0^{(0)}, c_1^{(0)}, \dots)\]
    W is a concrete point of the variables.

## DryadSynth: Enumerative search in heights

- Concrete expression could be substituted back to constraint, make constraints effectively constraints on coefficients. So for a set of input points $P$.
    \[\mathrm{Spec}(h,P) = \bigwedge_{w \in P} S(f(w) \to f, w \to (x_1, \dots, x_n))\]
- Search from $h = 1$, enumeratively increase $h$ if solution not found on current height.
- Checking and Solving is done with SMT Solver Z3 ^[L. de Moura and N. BjÃ¸rner, Z3: An Efficient SMT Solver. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2008, pp. 337â€“340]

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=4cm, auto, align=center]
\node[box] (input) {Input\\Specifications};
\node[box, inner sep=5mm, below of=input, node distance=3cm] (synth) {Synthesizer\\ \\ Solve\\ $\mathrm{Spec}(h,P)$ \\ Using Z3};

\node[box, below of=ver] (done) {Done, solution is $g$};
\path[->] (input) edge (synth)
(synth) edge node[below] {Suceed} node[above]{Candidate $g$} (ver)

(ver) edge node[right] {Add $w$ to $P$} (ce) (ce) edge  (synth)
(ver) edge node[right] {No $w$ \\exists} (done);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

## DryadSynth on INV problems

- INV problems are effectively CLIA predicate synthesis problems with restrictions on the form of the specifications.
- A CLIA predicate could be expressed in decision tree format as:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{tikzpicture}[level 1/.style={sibling distance=12em},
level 2/.style={sibling distance=6em}, align=center,
edge from parent/.style={->, draw},
auto]
\node [box] (root) {$p^{(0)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l1) {$p^{(1)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l2) {rtn \\ true} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r2) {rtn \\ false} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[left] {true}
}
child {node[box] (r1) {$p^{(2)}\ge 0$}
child {node[box] (l3) {rtn \\ true} edge from parent node[left]{true}}
child {node[box] (r3) {rtn \\ false} edge from parent node[right]{false}}
edge from parent node[right] {false}
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

- Thus our previous approach could be easily adapted.

## Optimizations on DryadSynth

- Parallelization
    - Naturally, CEGIS loop on different heights shall be independent to each other
    - Parallelization could leverage multi-cores
- Coefficient Bounds
    - Certain bounds set on coefficient could do a performance boost to the algorithm
- Prescreen Analysis
    - Prescreen of input problem could get rid of certain trivial problems that have a performance impact on the algorithm.

## Parallelization

- Different $h$ has different CEGIS processes
    - Counterexample sets do not need to be shared
    - Different CEGIS processes are entirely independent.
- On a $n$-core machine
    - Run on $h = 1 \to n$ initially
    - Set up a timeout for each thread
    - When a thread times out or yields no solution, process to next height that has not been processed yet.

## Coefficient Bounds

- Observations on typical CLIA problems indicate that
    - Most of the solutions' coefficients are very small, with lots of the coefficients being $\pm 1$
    - In rare cases, when solution contain large coefficient, there're often large coefficients in specifications
    - With coefficient bounded by certain bounds, a significant improvement in Z3 performance cound be archieved
        - This is due to the undeterministic nature of Z3's algorithm.

---

- In DryadSynth, we thus set Coefficient bounds for coefficients in synthesis
    - This effectively adds contraint in form of $a \le c_i^{(j)} \le b$ to $\mathrm{Spec}(h, P)$
    - DryadSynth split the coefficient search region into 3 parts
        - $0 \le |c| \le 1$
        - $1 < |c| \le c_b$
        - $|c| > c_b$
    - When a CEGIS process on lower region times out or yields no solution, advance to next region.
    - Set of counterexamples need to be shared between regions
    - $c_b$ is a bound chosen manually

## Prescreen Analysis

- Some trival cases have a huge impact on the naive approach's performance
- Unused variables: variables that defined and used in sythesis target parameters, but could be logically guaranteed that would not appear in solution
    - Z3's performance drops significantly when expression size increases
    - Eliminating unused variables would improve such performance
    - Archieved by logical analysis of input specifications.

# Results and Future Improvements

## Results

- In SyGuS-COMP'17:

. . .

- On CLIA tracks, total of 73 problems
    - DryadSynth solved 32 in time.
    - Winner solved all in time.
- On INV tracks, total of 74 problems
    - DryadSynth solved 64 in time.
    - Winner solved 65 in time.
- Not so good performance in CLIA, but pretty good in INV.

## Analysis

- Many CLIA problems are deep-in-height in nature
    - `max_n` and `array_search_n`
    - Deep decision trees are disasters to Z3 performance
    - But they're simple in problem formations
        - Could use other approaches to solve rather than CEGIS
- Most INV problems are simpler in tree structures, but somehow complex in formation
    - Best for decision tree representation
    - DryadSynth may suit better on INV problems.

## Possible Improvements

- Further Parallelization
    - Can different coefficient regions on same height be parallelized?
    - Possible, but need to take care of the counterexamples
- Adaptive coefficient bounds
    - As indicated before, coefficient value depends on coefficients in specifications
    - Set up coefficient bounds according to specification
- Other approaches
    - Idea: apply further syntactic constraints through assumptions that could capture a meaningful number of problems
    - Example: Single Invocation Problems.
